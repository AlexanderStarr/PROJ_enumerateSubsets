Project assignment for Algorithms class.  The prompt is as follows:

"For this assignment, you will modify the code enumerate.java to fulfil the following requirements.

-Modify the function (called method in java) enumerateSubsets so that it can handle sets of size up to 63 (currently it can handle only 31).

-Every for loop in java can be converted into a recursive algorithm without that loop. Please do this exercise for the first for loop in the function nextCombination

-Please implement a function called nextPermutation(int x[], int n), which is similar to nextCombination, such that when nextPermuation is called, it will modify x to generate next permutation. That is, suppose n = 9, if x contains [1, 2, 3,..., 8, 9] initially, repeated calls to nextPermuation will generate [1, 2, ..., 7, 9, 8], ..., until [9, 8, 7, ..., 2, 1]."

The file original.java is code supplied by the professor.  The file to be submitted is enumerate.java.  All changes to enumerate.java from original.java were written by Alexander Starr unless otherwise noted.
